# Entropy Estimation of DAC Profiles
This program estimate the entropy of Behavioral Authentication (BA) System profiles. A BA profile consists of a set of n d-dimensional vectors where each component of the vector is a feature value capturing specific behavioral property of the user. Due to the variations in users' behavior and accuracy of measuring systems, all vectors in a profile are not identical and have some variability.
